<b>HISTORY...</b></font></span></p>
<p>
<span class="text">Estridge developed our neighborhoods between 1992 and 
1999. The concept was to build two distinct housing areas that shared an 
expansive common area. </span><font size="2">The 121 homes of Brookstone 
were carefully designed as single family homes, averaging in&nbsp; size from 
1200 to 1700 square feet. The developer wanted to take advantage of the 
unique setting with its meandering streams and gently rolling terrain. 
The muted exterior colors, the common design elements such as the peaked 
roofs, and the professional landscaping work together to create an 
attractive residential community. There are four basic Brookstone floor plans, with 
two interior variations and two exterior variations, making 16 different 
living possibilities. The Fieldstone area consisted of 105 homes built 
along the meandering Robin Run creek. There are many basic floor plans 
for Fieldstone, as well as interior modifications and exterior treatments. The homes 
range in size from 1975 to 2500 square feet. Most are two-story 
residences with basements. Some have three car garages. </font>
