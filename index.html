			<h4>2008 Final Budget (Amended)</h4>
			
			<p>Linked below is the 2008 year end budget.  There was a shortfall 
			of $12,396.71 which resulted in the Board having to use reserve funds to cover 
			these expenses.</p>
			
			<p>The factors which caused the shortfall were:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Tree removal and trimming due to the wind storm in the spring.</li>
				<li>Preventative erosion maintenance of the ponds exceeded budget.</li>
				<li>Higher landscaping costs due to fuel and fertilizer prices.</li>
				<li>Reimbursable fees for legal services not collected.</li>
				<li>Reimbursable fees for lawn maintenance of vacant and/or delinquent homeowners that were not collected.</li>
				<li>Annual dues not received due to vacant, foreclosure or bankrupt properties.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Several of these items have been addressed in the 2009 budget. 
			In addition, all service contracts are being re-negotiated in an attempt to 
			maintain a balance budget for 2009. If 
			you have any questions please contact either the secretary or treasurer.</p>
