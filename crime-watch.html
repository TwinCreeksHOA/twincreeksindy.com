								There was a theft from a vehicle parked in a 
								Brookstone driveway on Friday morning, May 14<sup>th</sup>, 
								about 4:40 am. A neighbor heard some unusual 
								sounds and saw some car lights outside. He 
								looked out the window and saw a person dressed 
								head to foot in dark clothing running and 
								getting into the passenger side of a large white 
								car, possibly a Grand Marquis, which was waiting 
								across the street. The car had headlights, but 
								no taillights. This description is very similar 
								to that of a vehicle used in recent home 
								burglaries in our neighborhood. The car drove 
								away north on Twin Creeks Drive and east onto 
								Brookstone Way. The passenger side window of the 
								victimís truck was broken, and a digital camera 
								and cell phone had been stolen. The police were 
								immediately called.</span></p>

								Unfortunately, our community has become a 
								routine target for crooks. If you leave 
								valuables in your parked car, they are liable to 
								be stolen. If you leave your car unlocked and 
								parked outside your garage, it may be ransacked. 
								If you leave your garage door open and 
								unattended, your possessions may disappear. If 
								you leave your home unlocked, even when you are 
								home, you may have unwelcome criminal visitors. 
								If you leave expensive possessions in your home 
								within plain sight from your windows, burglars 
								may break in and steal them. If you fail to 
								maintain your coach lights or leave your porch 
								lights on at night, criminals may case out your

										<p class="MsoNormal">
										<span style="font-size: 9pt">The nice 
										spring weather doesn't just bring out 
										the tulips and daffodils. Unfortunately, 
										it also brings out the criminals.&nbsp; On 
										the afternoon of Tuesday, March 23, a 
										burglary occurred in Fieldstone. The 
										burglars evidently backed their vehicle 
										into the garage, and proceeded to steal 
										a big screen TV, a computer, jewelry, 
										and other valuables. Earlier that week, 
										a neighbor had confronted suspicious 
										individuals who are now believed to be 
										the burglars. They claimed to be hired 
										to do work for another homeowner, but 
										that homeowner denied they had hired 
										anyone. The victims filed a report with 
										the IMPD, but being new to the 
										neighborhood they did not know to notify 
										Crime Watch right away.</span></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal">
								<span style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal">
								<span style="font-size: 9pt">The suspects are 
								two African-American men in their lower 20s.They 
								were driving a white, older sedan--possibly a 
								Chevy Impala or Cavalier--with a hubcap missing 
								on the front driver's wheel.</span></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal">
								<span style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal">
								<span style="font-size: 9pt">Alarmingly, the 
								same pair has apparently been back to Fieldstone 
								in the past week, casing the site of their next 
								crime victim. A neighbor just around the corner 
								from the first location reported that on this 
								past Friday, April 9, at 10:10am, her doorbell 
								rang.&nbsp; Looking out the window, she noticed that 
								a white sedan had backed into her driveway and 
								the motor was still running. There was an 
								African-American man at her door and another 
								behind the wheel. When the man stepped off the 
								porch, the homeowner opened the door and asked 
								what he wanted. He hastily said he had the wrong 
								house, got in the car, and sped away. The 
								vehicle matched the description above, and had a 
								(possible) partial license plate of BE 538, 
								although the witness can't be certain of the 
								digits. She called the police, who arrived too 
								late to find the perpetrators.</span></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal">
								<span style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal">
								<span style="font-size: 9pt">We have seen 
								this mode of operation in years past. The crooks 
								come to the front door to try to confirm that 
								nobody is home, usually in broad daylight 
								between 10am and 2pm.&nbsp; If nobody comes to the 
								door, they walk around in back and look in the 
								windows. If they see no one, they break a 
								window, enter the house, open the garage door, 
								back-in the car, close the door, and steal all 
								the valuables. For this reason, it is imperative 
								that homeowners let their presence be known when 
								somebody comes to their door. You need not (and 
								should not) open your door to strangers, but you 
								should motion from the window, and/or yell 
								through the door that you are not interested. 
								The burglars do not want to encounter 
								resistance, and they will seek an unoccupied 
								house to steal from.</span></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal">
								<span style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal">
								<span style="font-size: 9pt">There has been 
								at least one other report of suspicious behavior 
								like that described above.&nbsp; It is somewhat 
								concerning that most houses in these instances 
								either actually had alarm systems or at least 
								had an alarm system sign in front. That has 
								typically been a deterrent, and burglars have 
								targeted homes without the signs. These burglars 
								are greedy, brazen, and persistent. 
								Consequently, they will likely be caught soon if 
								we watch out for ourselves and our neighbors.</span></p>

								If you leave valuables in your parked car, they 
								will be stolen. If you leave your car unlocked 
								and parked outside your garage, it will be 
								ransacked (whether or not you have left

										There are potential con artists trying 
										to sell door to door in our 
										neighborhood. The other night a guy came 
										to my door trying to sell me cleaning 
										supplies. I informed him that we had a 
										no soliciting sign at the entrance to 
										our neighborhood. &nbsp;He told me that the 
										HOA said it was ok....THE HOA HAS GIVEN 
										NO SUCH APPROVAL. &nbsp;He wanted to come 
										into my house to show me how his product 
										worked. I told him no and closed the 
										door. </font></p>
										<p style="margin-right: 8px">
										<font style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt" face="Times New Roman">
										<br>
										They came back this past Wednesday night 
										(7/16) while I was in the yard. So I 
										started asking questions. None of which 
										were really answered. The guy in the 
										truck said he did not work for the 
										company and that he was just the driver 
										and would not give me any company info. 
										Then sped off leaving his salesman at my 
										neighbors house. &nbsp;When he came out of 
										the house from delivering his product he 
										also refused to give me any 
										documentation of his company , I had to 
										copy down the info off of his receipt 
										book. He had no business cards and said 
										that you could only order from them in 
										person. They were out of Dallas TX but 
										the receipt said Plano TX. &nbsp;They said 
										they travel around to 31 states selling 
										their products. &nbsp;He said the company is 
										Xtreme Chemical Company or Mike Wright 
										Enterprises. or MWE Sales. This is also 
										a key trick of multiple names to avoid 
										lawsuits. &nbsp;A two second Goggle search of 
										Xtreme Chemical Company showed lots of 
										complaints that they do not deliver the 
										same product they demo in your home. 
										&nbsp;The phone number they gave was 
										972-422-7272 and an address of 1707 
										Mimosa, Plano, TX, 45074. &nbsp;There is only 
										a three day return policy listed on 
										their website and good luck getting them 
										to even give you your money back. <br>

										While the people have done nothing 
										criminal, please proceed with caution 
										and notify them that THE HOA DOES NOT 
										APPROVE OF SOLICITORS AND IF THEY DO NOT 
										LEAVE THE AUTHORITIES WILL BE NOTIFIED.</font></p>

										Somebody knocked loudly on a Fieldstone 
										homeownerís door (Lot #2). The homeowner 
										did not go to the door and make her 
										presence known. Shortly thereafter, two 
										light-skinned African American men in 
										their late teens were heard and then

										The difference between this incident and

										known when her doorbell rang.&nbsp; She went 
										to see who it was, didn't know them, and 
										told them &quot;no thanks&quot; through the side 
										window without opening the door. That 
										was sufficient to deter the suspects in 
										that earlier incident, who were dressed 
										in all black, carrying gloves, and 
										rapidly disappeared in a dark green car 
										when they found somebody at home. On 
										this past Wednesday, the burglars 
										thought the home was empty, so they

										to encounter inhabitants in a house. It 
										is important to make your presence known 
										if there is a visitor at your front 
										door. This will typically deter 
										burglars, who prefer to commit their 
										crimes without interference. Do not open 
										your door to strangers, but do send them 
										away by speaking through the window of 
										the locked door. With schools out, it is
