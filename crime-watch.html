								<h4>What is Crime Watch?</h4>
								<p>Neighborhood Crime Watch is a volunteer 
								organization composed of Brookstone/Fieldstone 
								residents like you. Its mission is to prevent 
								crime in our neighborhood and notify neighbors 
								when a crime does occur. This way, we stand a 
								better chance of preventing repeat incidents and 
								possibly helping the police with information 
								vital to apprehending criminals. Crime Watch is 
								not intended to intervene in a crime-in case of 
								an emergency or suspected crime in progress, 
								<em>always dial 911</em>.</p>
								
								<h4>Crime Watch Phone Tree Notification Process</h4>
								<ol>
									<li>When 
								an incident occurs in the neighborhood, the 
								victim should notify one of their Block Captains 
								(of course after notifying the police, as 
								appropriate). Alternatively, the information can 
								be sent to
								<a href="mailto:wyattsmt@aol.com?subject=Crime Watch">
								wyattsmt@aol.com</a>.</li>
								
									<li>The 
								victim should provide all pertinent information, 
								such as the crime, location, property stolen or 
								damaged, time and date, whether there is a 
								description of the suspect, and whether the 
								victim notified the police. It is the victim's 
								prerogative whether or not to notify the 
								Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, 
								however Crime Watch strongly encourages them to 
								do so.</li>
									<li>The 
								Block Captain passes the information along to 
								the Neighborhood Coordinator, who then initiates 
								the phone tree by calling each Block Captain in 
								the neighborhood.</li>
									<li>Each 
								Block Captain notifies their block Co-Captain. 
								Together, the captains and Co-Captains notify 
								everyone on their block. This may entail a phone 
								conversation, an answering machine message, or a 
								flier.</li>
								<h4>National Night 
								Out Against Crime Ice Cream Social</h4>
								<p>Crime Watch's 
								big annual event is the National Night Out (NNO) 
								Against Crime. The purpose of NNO is to make a 
								statement that our neighborhood is organized to 
								resist crime and support law enforcement. Each 
								year, on the first Tuesday night in August, 
								neighbors are encouraged to turn on their porch 
								lights and attend an Ice Cream Social, hosted by 
								Crime Watch and sponsored by the TCHOA. This is 
								a great chance to socialize with your neighbors 
								and eat some free ice cream! Watch for a flier 
								with details toward the end of July each year.</p>
								</ol>
								
								<h4>Volunteering for 
								Crime Watch</h4>
								<p>Although all 
								volunteer positions are currently filled, 
								turnover is inevitable. You are encouraged to 
								consider volunteering for the Crime Watch 
								Committee. The time commitment is minimal-you 
								are merely responsible to make about a dozen 
								phone calls to your neighbors whenever a crime 
								is reported in our community. Being a Block 
								Captain is a great way to stay in touch with 
								your neighbors, welcome the newcomers, and 
								promote a safer community. The program is truly 
								rewarding, as it enhances the quality of life 
								and property values in our community. <em>Any 
								willing volunteers should contact</em>
								<a href="mailto:wyattsmt@aol.com?subject=Crime Watch">
								wyattsmt@aol.com</a>.</p>
								
								<h4>What You Can Do 
								to Prevent Crime</h4>
								<p>Keeping your 
								coach lights and porch lights maintained is one 
								way you can prevent crime in our neighborhood. 
								So is parking your vehicles in your garage, 
								since theft from vehicles is by far the most 
								common crime committed in Twin Creeks. It is 
								also vital that we communicate with one another 
								and look out for one another. Neighbors should 
								never ignore suspicious behavior or an open 
								garage door late at night. Good neighbors get to 
								know one another by name and help one another 
								out as needed. If that's not the case on your 
								block, don't be satisfied-take it upon yourself 
								to meet your neighbors and talk to them. Make 
								the first move to introduce yourself. Only then 
								can we build a stronger community!</p>


								<h4>Crime Prevention Tips</h4>

								<ol>
									<li>Keep your garage door closed anytime you are 
									not in the garage</li>
									<li>Park your cars in the garage; if you must 
									park outside, lock your car doors</li>
									<li>Don't leave anything in your parked car that 
									you want to keep (laptop, cell phone, 
									wallet, purse, keys, auto title, garage door 
									opener, iPod)</li>
									<li>Lock your house, front door and back, 
									whether you are home or not</li>
									<li>Keep all exterior light bulbs 
									maintained-florescent bulbs last much long</li>
									<li>Leave your porch lights on at night, front 
									and back</li>
									<li>If you don't have an alarm system, invest in 
									one and pay for the monitoring</li>
								</ol>
