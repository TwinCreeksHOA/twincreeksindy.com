<dl class="faq">
	<dt>What is the Twin Creeks Homeowners Association?</dt>
	<dd><p>The Twin Creeks Homeowners Association (TCHOA) was part of the 
	initial housing plan, incorporated by 
	the developer to maintain the common areas, provide various services to 
	residents and to control future architectural development. Membership 
	in and payment of annual dues to TCHOA is mandatory for all homeowners. 
	The <em>Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions for Twin Creeks</em> 
	is part of the deed to each lot in Fieldstone and Brookstone.</p></dd>
	
	<dt>How much are the annual dues?</dt>
	<dd><p>The annual dues are $321.00 payable every January 1.  Late fees are an 
	additional $39.00</p></dd>

	<dt>How are the dues spent?</dt>
	<dd><p>The annual homeowner dues are used to 
	cover such things as street lighting, mowing and landscaping of common 
	areas, maintenance of retention ponds, maintenance of signage, common 
	area fences and entrance structures, snow removal, insurance, common 
	area property taxes and related administrative expenses.</p></dd>
	
	<dt>Is there a Board that handles the business of Twin Creeks Homeowners Association (TCHOA)?</dt>
	<dd><p>Yes. The TCHOA Board of Directors are 
	elected each year in May or June at the annual meeting of the homeowners 
	association. Each position is strictly a volunteer commitment from 
	fellow homeowners who are willing to dedicate their time and effort to 
	ensure the proper handling of homeowner business.</p></dd>
	
	<dt>Are there any committees at Twin Creeks and how can I get involved?</dt>
	<dd><p>Yes. The TCHOA welcomes the involvement of all residents. The current 
	committees are as follows: Crime Watch, Architectural Review, Social 
	Committee and Welcome Committee. In addition, we are looking for 
	creative people to start various other neighborhood events, activities 
	and clubs. Each of these committees are looking 
	for volunteers who would like to participate. If you are interested 
	please email the Board.</p>
